## Analysis.py ##

Analysis.py is a Phyton based code to:

• outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
• saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
• outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.


## Data ##

IRIS.CSV - "Iris" dataset. Originally published at UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set, this small dataset from 1936 is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations (for example, Scatter Plot). Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.
