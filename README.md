IRIS.CSV - "Iris" dataset. Originally published at UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set, this small dataset from 1936 is 
often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations (for example, Scatter Plot). Each row of the table 
represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.
